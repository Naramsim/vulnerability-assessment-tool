@@PROJECT_NAME@@ is meant to run within the **internal** network of software development organizations, and this tutorial is meant to facilitate the operation of @@PROJECT_NAME@@ using **local** Docker repositories or **local** container orchestration systems (e.g., Kubernetes or OpenShift).

**Important**: Because @@PROJECT_NAME@@ does not currently implement authorization functionality, it is not advised to expose an instance of @@PROJECT_NAME@@ to the public Internet.
